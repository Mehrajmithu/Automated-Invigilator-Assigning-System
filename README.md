# Utilize Agile SDLC Model 

Automated Invigilator Assignment System developed by agile model in 3 sprint

### Each sprint involved:

- Requirements gathering to capture user needs and constraints

- Requirements design to translate needs into functional specifications

- Testing/Quality assurance to ensure accuracy and reliability

- Review to evaluate progress and incorporate feedback
